Martin Silberberg's SQL Portfolio

Currently, the various files in this portfolio were various queries used as solutions to a complex SQL programming assignment.

While the original prompts and SQL database are currently unavailable, the intention of each query should be clear from the comments in each file. This portfolio is meant to display the user's understanding of the syntax of SQL and pgsql syntax, as well as problem solving skills related to SQL code.
